This is the computer code corresponding to the following publication:

"Effects of site‐selection bias on estimates of biodiversity change"  
Andrea Mentges, Shane Blowes, Dorothée Hodapp, Helmut Hillebrand, Jon Chase  
Conservation Biology, Vol. 35 (2), 2020  
doi: 10.1111/cobi.13610

The code contains the functions needed to generate the simulation data and to plot the figures.
To get started, open "MAIN_SCRIPT.m", which calls the sub-functions.
